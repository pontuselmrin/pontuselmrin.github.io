In linear algebra, it is typically helpful to be able to move between different perspectives on the same topic. A classic example of this is the [set of equivalent statements regarding matrix invertibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix).

One area where it's useful to have multiple perspectives in mind is matrix multiplication. I recently came across [Eli Bendersky's excellent article](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/) on different ways to visualize matrix multiplication. Inspired by his post, I wanted to highlight yet another way of looking at it:

Reviewing different interpretations and visualizations of matrix multiplication can help with intuition. Iâ€™ve found it useful to make some flashcards summarizing these perspectives and revisiting them regularly, to keep the different perspectives in mind. I suggest you to visit [Bendersky's article](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/) and brush up on those perspectives to complement the one pictured above.
