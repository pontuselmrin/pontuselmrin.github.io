In linear algebra, the ability to move between different perspectives on the same topic is typically very useful. A classic example of this is the long list of equivalent statements regarding matrix invertibility.[^1]

As such, I was happy to come across Eli Bendersky's [excellent article](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/) on different ways to visualize matrix multiplication. Inspired by his post, I wanted to highlight yet another way of looking at it:

![Matrix Multiplication - Perspective 2](/assets/images/matmul2.png)

The pictures demonstrate how we can view a matrix product as a sum of rank-one matrices. This idea appears in many useful contexts, such as when decomposing a matrix, or when computing attention scores in Transformers. 

In general, reviewing different interpretations and visualizations of matrix multiplication can help with intuition. Iâ€™ve found it useful to make some flashcards summarizing these perspectives and revisiting them regularly, to keep the different perspectives in mind. I suggest anyone visit Bendersky's [article](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/) and brush up on those perspectives to complement the one pictured above.
