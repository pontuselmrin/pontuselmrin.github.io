 One result in linear algebra can be said in multiple ways: the most famous of which (arguably) is the long list of equivalent statements as to whether or not a matrix is invertible or not. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix).

That's why I thought it was so great to read Eli Bendersky's post on different perspectives on visualizing matrix multiplication. To complement his excellent article, I just wanted to demonstrate yet another way of looking at matrix multiplication. I found it very helpful to put all of these different perspectives into flashcards and to review them as they come up, to always remember to think of matrix multiplication from different perspectives. https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/

In linear algebra, it is typically helpful to be able to move between different perspectives on the same topic. A classic example of this is the set of equivalent statements regarding matrix invertibility ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix)).

One area where multiple perspectives are particularly enlightening is matrix multiplication. I recently came across [Eli Bendersky's excellent article](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/) on different ways to visualize matrix multiplication. Inspired by his post, I wanted to highlight yet another way of looking at it:

Reviewing different interpretations and visualizations of matrix multiplication can deepen intuition. Iâ€™ve found it helpful to make some flashcards summarizing these perspectives and revisiting them regularly, to keep the different perspectives in mind. I suggest you visit [Bendersky's article](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/) and brush up on those perspectives to complement the one pictured above.
