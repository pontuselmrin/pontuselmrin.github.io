In Linear Algebra, it is typically helpful to be able to move between different perspectives on the same topic. One result in linear algebra can be said in multiple ways: the most famous of which (arguably) is the long list of equivalent statements as to whether or not a matrix is invertible or not. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix).

That's why I thought it was so great to read Eli Bendersky's post on different perspectives on visualizing matrix multiplication. To complement his excellent article, I just wanted to demonstrate yet another way of looking at matrix multiplication. I found it very helpful to put all of these different perspectives into flashcards and to review them as they come up, to always remember to think of matrix multiplication from different perspectives. https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/
